# Deprecation Plan <!-- omit in toc -->

The following is a list of deprecations, according to the [Deprecation Policy](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#deprecation-policy). After a feature becomes deprecated, and giving developers time to adapt to the change, the deprecated feature will eventually be removed, leading to a breaking change. Developer feedback during the deprecation period may postpone the introduction of the breaking change.
