 * @property {Boolean} directAccess Set to `true` if Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server should be routed to Parse Server directly instead of via the HTTP interface. Default is `false`.<br><br>If set to `false` then Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server are executed as HTTP requests sent to Parse Server via the `serverURL`. For example, a `Parse.Query` in Cloud Code is calling Parse Server via a HTTP request. The server is essentially making a HTTP request to itself, unnecessarily using network resources such as network ports.<br><br>⚠️ In environments where multiple Parse Server instances run behind a load balancer and Parse requests within the current Node.js environment should be routed via the load balancer and distributed as HTTP requests among all instances via the `serverURL`, this should be set to `false`.

 * @property {Number} emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration Set the validity duration of the email verification token in seconds after which the token expires. The token is used in the link that is set in the email. After the token expires, the link becomes invalid and a new link has to be sent.
