# [5.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/compare/4.10.4...5.0.0-alpha.1) (2021-10-12)

## Breaking Changes
- Improved schema caching through database real-time hooks. Reduces DB queries, decreases Parse Query execution time and fixes a potential schema memory leak. If multiple Parse Server instances connect to the same DB (for example behind a load balancer), set the [Parse Server Option](https://parseplatform.org/parse-server/api/master/ParseServerOptions.html) `databaseOptions.enableSchemaHooks: true` to enable this feature and keep the schema in sync across all instances. Failing to do so will cause a schema change to not propagate to other instances and re-syncing will only happen when these instances restart. The options `enableSingleSchemaCache` and `schemaCacheTTL` have been removed. To use this feature with MongoDB, a replica set cluster with [change stream](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/#availability) support is required. (Diamond Lewis, SebC) [#7214](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/issues/7214)
- Added file upload restriction. File upload is now only allowed for authenticated users by default for improved security. To allow file upload also for Anonymous Users or Public, set the `fileUpload` parameter in the [Parse Server Options](https://parseplatform.org/parse-server/api/master/ParseServerOptions.html) (dblythy, Manuel Trezza) [#7071](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7071)
- Removed [parse-server-simple-mailgun-adapter](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server-simple-mailgun-adapter) dependency; to continue using the adapter it has to be explicitly installed (Manuel Trezza) [#7321](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7321)
- Remove support for MongoDB 3.6 which has reached its End-of-Life date and PostgreSQL 10 (Manuel Trezza) [#7315](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7315)
- Remove support for Node 10 which has reached its End-of-Life date (Manuel Trezza) [#7314](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7314)
- Remove S3 Files Adapter from Parse Server, instead install separately as `@parse/s3-files-adapter` (Manuel Trezza) [#7324](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7324)
- Remove Session field `restricted`; the field was a code artifact from a feature that never existed in Open Source Parse Server; if you have been using this field for custom purposes, consider that for new Parse Server installations the field does not exist anymore in the schema, and for existing installations the field default value `false` will not be set anymore when creating a new session (Manuel Trezza) [#7543](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7543)
- ci: add node engine version check (Manuel Trezza) [#7574](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/7574)
