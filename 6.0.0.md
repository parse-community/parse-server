## Asynchronous Initialization

Previously, it was possible to mount Parse Server before it was fully started up and ready to receive requests. This could result in undefined behavior, such as Parse Objects could be saved before Cloud Code was registered. To prevent this, Parse Server 6 requires to be started asynchronously before being mounted.

*Parse Server 5:*
```js
const ParseServer = require('parse-server');
const server = new ParseServer(config);
app.use("/parse", server);
```

*Parse Server 6:*
```js
const ParseServer = require('parse-server');
const server = new ParseServer(config);
await server.start(); // Starts Parse Server and returns only after it's fully started up
app.use("/parse", server.app);
```
