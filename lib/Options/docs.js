 * @property {String} allowOrigin Sets the origin to Access-Control-Allow-Origin
 * @property {Adapter<AnalyticsAdapter>} analyticsAdapter Adapter module for the analytics
 * @property {String} appId Your Parse Application ID
 * @property {String} appName Sets the app name
 * @property {Any} auth Configuration for your authentication providers, as stringified JSON. See http://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#oauth-and-3rd-party-authentication
 * @property {Adapter<CacheAdapter>} cacheAdapter Adapter module for the cache
 * @property {Number} cacheMaxSize Sets the maximum size for the in memory cache, defaults to 10000
 * @property {Number} cacheTTL Sets the TTL for the in memory cache (in ms), defaults to 5000 (5 seconds)
 * @property {String} clientKey Key for iOS, MacOS, tvOS clients
 * @property {String} cloud Full path to your cloud code main.js

 * @property {DatabaseOptions} databaseOptions Options to pass to the database client
 * @property {String} databaseURI The full URI to your database. Supported databases are mongodb or postgres.
 * @property {Boolean} directAccess Set to `true` if Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server should be routed to Parse Server directly instead of via the HTTP interface. Default is `false`.<br><br>If set to `false` then Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server are executed as HTTP requests sent to Parse Server via the `serverURL`. For example, a `Parse.Query` in Cloud Code is calling Parse Server via a HTTP request. The server is essentially making a HTTP request to itself, unnecessarily using network resources such as network ports.<br><br>⚠️ In environments where multiple Parse Server instances run behind a load balancer and Parse requests within the current Node.js environment should be routed via the load balancer and distributed as HTTP requests among all instances via the `serverURL`, this should be set to `false`.

 * @property {Number} emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration Set the validity duration of the email verification token in seconds after which the token expires. The token is used in the link that is set in the email. After the token expires, the link becomes invalid and a new link has to be sent. If the option is not set or set to `undefined`, then the token never expires.<br><br>For example, to expire the token after 2 hours, set a value of 7200 seconds (= 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 2 hours).<br><br>Default is `undefined`.<br>Requires option `verifyUserEmails: true`.
