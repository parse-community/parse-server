 * @property {Number} defaultLimit Default value for limit option on queries, defaults to `100`.
 * @property {Boolean} directAccess Set to `true` if Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server should be routed to Parse Server directly instead of via the HTTP interface. Default is `false`.<br><br>If set to `false` then Parse requests within the same Node.js environment as Parse Server are executed as HTTP requests sent to Parse Server via the `serverURL`. For example, a `Parse.Query` in Cloud Code is calling Parse Server via a HTTP request. The server is essentially making a HTTP request to itself, unnecessarily using network resources such as network ports.<br><br>⚠️ In environments where multiple Parse Server instances run behind a load balancer and Parse requests within the current Node.js environment should be routed via the load balancer and distributed as HTTP requests among all instances via the `serverURL`, this should be set to `false`.

 * @property {String} dotNetKey Key for Unity and .Net SDK
 * @property {Adapter<MailAdapter>} emailAdapter Adapter module for email sending
 * @property {Boolean} emailVerifyTokenReuseIfValid Set to `true` if a email verification token should be reused in case another token is requested but there is a token that is still valid, i.e. has not expired. This avoids the often observed issue that a user requests multiple emails and does not know which link contains a valid token because each newly generated token would invalidate the previous token.<br><br>Default is `false`.<br>Requires option `verifyUserEmails: true`.
 * @property {Number} emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration Set the validity duration of the email verification token in seconds after which the token expires. The token is used in the link that is set in the email. After the token expires, the link becomes invalid and a new link has to be sent. If the option is not set or set to `undefined`, then the token never expires.<br><br>For example, to expire the token after 2 hours, set a value of 7200 seconds (= 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 2 hours).<br><br>Default is `undefined`.<br>Requires option `verifyUserEmails: true`.
 * @property {Boolean} enableAnonymousUsers Enable (or disable) anonymous users, defaults to true
 * @property {Boolean} enableExpressErrorHandler Enables the default express error handler for all errors
 * @property {Boolean} encodeParseObjectInCloudFunction If set to `true`, a `Parse.Object` that is in the payload when calling a Cloud Function will be converted to an instance of `Parse.Object`. If `false`, the object will not be converted and instead be a plain JavaScript object, which contains the raw data of a `Parse.Object` but is not an actual instance of `Parse.Object`. Default is `false`. <br><br>ℹ️ The expected behavior would be that the object is converted to an instance of `Parse.Object`, so you would normally set this option to `true`. The default is `false` because this is a temporary option that has been introduced to avoid a breaking change when fixing a bug where JavaScript objects are not converted to actual instances of `Parse.Object`.

This key is intended to conduct out-of-band changes such as one-time migrations or data correction tasks. Internal fields are not officially documented and may change at any time without publication in release changelogs. We strongly advice not to rely on internal fields as part of your regular operation and to investigate the implications of any planned changes *directly in the source code* of your current version of Parse Server.
 * @property {String[]} maintenanceKeyIps (Optional) Restricts the use of maintenance key permissions to a list of IP addresses.<br><br>This option accepts a list of single IP addresses, for example:<br>`['10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.2']`<br><br>You can also use CIDR notation to specify an IP address range, for example:<br>`['10.0.1.0/24']`<br><br>Special cases:<br>- Setting an empty array `[]` means that `maintenanceKey` cannot be used even in Parse Server Cloud Code.<br>- Setting `['0.0.0.0/0']` means disabling the filter and the maintenance key can be used from any IP address.<br><br>Defaults to `['127.0.0.1', '::1']` which means that only `localhost`, the server itself, is allowed to use the maintenance key.
 * @property {String} masterKey Your Parse Master Key
 * @property {String[]} masterKeyIps (Optional) Restricts the use of master key permissions to a list of IP addresses.<br><br>This option accepts a list of single IP addresses, for example:<br>`['10.0.0.1', '10.0.0.2']`<br><br>You can also use CIDR notation to specify an IP address range, for example:<br>`['10.0.1.0/24']`<br><br>Special cases:<br>- Setting an empty array `[]` means that `masterKey` cannot be used even in Parse Server Cloud Code.<br>- Setting `['0.0.0.0/0']` means disabling the filter and the master key can be used from any IP address.<br><br>To connect Parse Dashboard from a different server requires to add the IP address of the server that hosts Parse Dashboard because Parse Dashboard uses the master key.<br><br>Defaults to `['127.0.0.1', '::1']` which means that only `localhost`, the server itself, is allowed to use the master key.
 * @property {Number} maxLimit Max value for limit option on queries, defaults to unlimited

 * @property {Boolean} preventLoginWithUnverifiedEmail Set to `true` to prevent a user from logging in if the email has not yet been verified and email verification is required.<br><br>Default is `false`.<br>Requires option `verifyUserEmails: true`.
 * @property {Boolean} preventSignupWithUnverifiedEmail If set to `true` it prevents a user from signing up if the email has not yet been verified and email verification is required. In that case the server responds to the sign-up with HTTP status 400 and a Parse Error 205 `EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`. If set to `false` the server responds with HTTP status 200, and client SDKs return an unauthenticated Parse User without session token. In that case subsequent requests fail until the user's email address is verified.<br><br>Default is `false`.<br>Requires option `verifyUserEmails: true`.
 * @property {ProtectedFields} protectedFields Protected fields that should be treated with extra security when fetching details.

 * @property {Any} push Configuration for push, as stringified JSON. See http://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#push-notifications
 * @property {RateLimitOptions[]} rateLimit Options to limit repeated requests to Parse Server APIs. This can be used to protect sensitive endpoints such as `/requestPasswordReset` from brute-force attacks or Parse Server as a whole from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.<br><br>ℹ️ Mind the following limitations:<br>- rate limits applied per IP address; this limits protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks where many requests are coming from various IP addresses<br>- if multiple Parse Server instances are behind a load balancer or ran in a cluster, each instance will calculate it's own request rates, independent from other instances; this limits the applicability of this feature when using a load balancer and another rate limiting solution that takes requests across all instances into account may be more suitable<br>- this feature provides basic protection against denial-of-service attacks, but a more sophisticated solution works earlier in the request flow and prevents a malicious requests to even reach a server instance; it's therefore recommended to implement a solution according to architecture and user case.
 * @property {String} readOnlyMasterKey Read-only key, which has the same capabilities as MasterKey without writes
 * @property {Function} requestContextMiddleware Options to customize the request context using inversion of control/dependency injection.
 * @property {RequestKeywordDenylist[]} requestKeywordDenylist An array of keys and values that are prohibited in database read and write requests to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. It is possible to specify only a key (`{"key":"..."}`), only a value (`{"value":"..."}`) or a key-value pair (`{"key":"...","value":"..."}`). The specification can use the following types: `boolean`, `numeric` or `string`, where `string` will be interpreted as a regex notation. Request data is deep-scanned for matching definitions to detect also any nested occurrences. Defaults are patterns that are likely to be used in malicious requests. Setting this option will override the default patterns.
 * @property {String} restAPIKey Key for REST calls
 * @property {Boolean} revokeSessionOnPasswordReset When a user changes their password, either through the reset password email or while logged in, all sessions are revoked if this is true. Set to false if you don't want to revoke sessions.

 * @property {Function} serverCloseComplete Callback when server has closed
 * @property {String} serverURL URL to your parse server with http:// or https://.
 * @property {Number} sessionLength Session duration, in seconds, defaults to 1 year
 * @property {Boolean} silent Disables console output
 * @property {Boolean} startLiveQueryServer Starts the liveQuery server
 * @property {Any} trustProxy The trust proxy settings. It is important to understand the exact setup of the reverse proxy, since this setting will trust values provided in the Parse Server API request. See the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html">express trust proxy settings</a> documentation. Defaults to `false`.
 * @property {String[]} userSensitiveFields Personally identifiable information fields in the user table the should be removed for non-authorized users. Deprecated @see protectedFields
 * @property {Boolean} verbose Set the logging to verbose
 * @property {Boolean} verifyUserEmails Set to `true` to require users to verify their email address to complete the sign-up process. Supports a function with a return value of `true` or `false` for conditional verification.<br><br>Default is `false`.
